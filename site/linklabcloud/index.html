<h1 id="linklabcloud">Link Lab Cloud</h1>
<p>The Link Lab cloud is a cloud-hosted streaming data backend that supports dozens
of sensor deployments and applications that use streaming sensor data.</p>
<h2 id="underlyingtechnologies">Underlying Technologies</h2>
<p>The Link Lab Cloud is built on (InfluxDB
v1](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/), a timeseries database for
streaming data.</p>
<p><a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> provides connections between data sources and the
database.</p>
<p>All metadata are stored in a Postgres database and appended as tags for each
data item streamed to the Link Lab Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="dataformat">Data Format</h2>
<h3 id="datastoredinthedatabase">Data Stored in the Database</h3>
<p>All datapoints in the LLC are stored in this general format:</p>
<pre><code>Measurement: &lt;measurement name&gt;
  value: &lt;measurement value&gt;

Tags:
  &lt;tag name&gt;: &lt;tag value&gt;
  ...

Timestamp: &lt;nanosecond timestamp&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This format follows the InfluxDBv1 format, except we use only a single field in
the measurement, which is always called "value". This makes it easier to query
for a specific type of data, no matter which sensor type or source it originated
from (since all temperature data will have the same measurement name and same
field name).</p>
<h3 id="datasenttollc">Data Sent to LLC</h3>
<p>When sending data to the LLC, the data are generally in the following JSON-esque
format:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "&lt;measurement1&gt;": value1,
    "&lt;measurement2&gt;": value2,
    ...
    "_meta": {
        "device_id": "&lt;unique device id&gt;",
        "receiver": "&lt;source of the data&gt;",
        "model_number": "&lt;model #&gt;",
        ...
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p><code>device_id</code> is required.</p>
<p><strong>Important!</strong> It is critical that all fields in the <code>_meta</code> object change
<strong>rarely</strong> for each device_id. The <code>_meta</code> fields should be fixed properties of
the device (e.g. the model number of the sensor) and NOT a sensor reading (e.g.
output of a GPS). It is ok to change the <code>_meta</code> fields _occasionally_ (e.g.
every three months), or on rare occasions (like the device is moved to a new
location). Any value which is dynamic must be stored in the normal measurement
key-value pairs.</p>
<h3 id="standarddatakeys">Standard Data Keys</h3>
<p>To make it easier to query for data across sensors, we maintain a list of known
measurement names that sensors should use if possible. They are listed in the
table:</p>
<p>| InfluxDB Measurement Name | Description                                                                |

<p>Of course, this is far from comprehensive. Other datastreams may use other
measurement names.</p>
<p>In general, we have found it useful to use the format <code>&lt;data type&gt;_&lt;unit&gt;</code>. This
balances complexity (it is fairly simple) with readability (queriers can
generally tell what the data are.)</p>
<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>
<p>Metadata for the LLC is stored in a table with the following structure:</p>
<p>| Column            | Type                   | Description                                                                                                                                                    |

<p>On each matching <code>device_id == sensorid</code>, the other fields are appended as tags
to the incoming data point.</p>
